Scrambled Egg Simulator is a foolhardy attempt at modelling hypersonic flight - starting with ramjets/scramjet engines. Depending on what you want to do, you need to use either of the two (as of 1 March 2025) versions:
- [v0.1 is for assessing the performance of a single ram/scramjet design for a single set of conditions:](https://github.com/PearBabyPlc/scrambled-egg-simulator/tree/main/v0.1) it creates a nice intake geometry plot, and gives you vague performance values.
- [v0.2 is for roughly estimating performance of only scramjets (not ramjets) within a range of intake ramp angle configs:](https://github.com/PearBabyPlc/scrambled-egg-simulator/tree/main/v0.2) it iterates through the configs for a defined Mach range and dynamic pressure, and outputs a plot of performance indicators (specific impulse and excess thrust), as well as a bunch of other values in the churning command line (which may have thousands of entries)
