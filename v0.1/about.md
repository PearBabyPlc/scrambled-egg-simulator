Version 0.1 is a rough model of a ramjet intake, combustor and exhaust. It can generate intake geometry, predict conditions at different points, and estimate overall performance. 
It is not very effective for that purpose, and that is why it is being "released" in this alpha version. I really don't know what the fuck I'm doing with github or python, so I'm just gonna move all these old files into a pit.
The next version, 0.2, will be significantly optimised, hopefully more useful, and no longer smeared out across far too many random files. Amogus
