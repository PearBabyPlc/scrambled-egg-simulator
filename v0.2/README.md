Structure:
- runModel.py (Numerically solving for the best performance at a given Mach for a set of ramp angles)
- buzzerrookie_isa.py (BuzzerRookie's International Standard Atmosphere calculator, with a few tweaks for my use)
- kyleniemeyer_gasdynamics.py (Whenever my attempts at solving various aerodynamics problems fails, Kyle Niemeyer is there to help)
- formulaegg.py (Random equations and shit that other bits of code can use for science)
- nozzle.py (Rayleigh flow de Laval nozzle solver for estimation)
- geometryDrag.py (Calculates intake geometry and drag, for evaluation of practicality and performance (excess thrust, specific impulse)
- unused.py (I have no idea)
